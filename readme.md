## How to run project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run serve`
Serves the app using Vite's built-in preview server, which is suitable for previewing the production build locally.

### `npm run format`
Formats the code using Prettier for all TypeScript, TSX, and JSON files in the `src` directory.

### `npm run lint`
Lints and fixes the files in the `src` directory using ESLint.

Don't forget to run `npm run prepare` after cloning the repository to set up Husky for Git hooks.

<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project

This project is an all-encompassing application that integrates multiple functionalities, making it a powerhouse of tools and services. Key features include:

1. **Multi-Application Suite**: The app includes a variety of sub-applications like a Todo app, Chat app, Calendar app, a Shopping module, User management, and advanced Dashboard analytics or e-commerce.

2. **Ongoing Development and Expansion**: The application is in a continuous state of development, adding new features and improving existing ones.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Special attention has been paid to optimize the application for performance, accessibility, and scalability.

At the moment, we do not have a landing page, so I tested a few initial pages, such as the login.

4.  **Media asset Optimization**: We've optimized our media assets by converting images from formats like PNG to more efficient WebP and SVG formats, significantly reducing file sizes without sacrificing quality. The use of SVGO further enhances our SVG files, streamlining them for optimal performance and faster page load times. This approach ensures a visually rich yet high-performing web experience. 
   
5. **Availability**: In ensuring high availability for our application, we've focused not just on the system's uptime but also on its accessibility to all users. Leveraging the capabilities of the Radix UI library, we've enhanced the user experience to be inclusive and navigable for everyone. This library has been instrumental in making our application fully accessible, catering to a diverse user base including those who rely on keyboard navigation and screen readers.
6. **Firebase Integration**: Currently, the app uses Firebase for database access. Additionally, plans are underway to introduce a feature allowing easy migration to either Firebase or any custom API for different backend solutions.

7. **End-to-End Testing**: The project has initiated End-to-End (E2E) testing, simulating real user interactions to improve code quality. [Show me tests](#camera-video)

8. **Technology Stack**: The app is built using a range of modern libraries and technologies, including but not limited to:

    - FullCalendar suite (`@fullcalendar/core`, `@fullcalendar/daygrid`, `@fullcalendar/interaction`, `@fullcalendar/react`) for calendar functionalities.
    - Radix UI components (`@radix-ui/react-popover`, `@radix-ui/react-radio-group`, `@radix-ui/react-select`, `@radix-ui/react-separator`, `@radix-ui/react-tooltip`) for UI elements.
    - `@react-pdf/renderer` for PDF rendering capabilities.
    - Axios (`axios`) for HTTP requests.
    - Chart.js (`chart.js`) and React Chartjs 2 (`react-chartjs-2`) for data visualization.
    - Date manipulation utilities (`date-fns`).
    - Firebase (`firebase`) as the database solution.
    - React (`react`, `react-dom`) and associated libraries for building the user interface.
    - Tailwind CSS (`tailwindcss`) for styling.
    - Zustand (`zustand`) for state management.

9. **Developer Tools and Testing**: The project makes extensive use of development and testing tools like Cypress for E2E testing, ESLint for code linting, and Husky for managing Git hooks.

10. **Acknowledgment**: Special thanks to  <a href="https://pl.linkedin.com/in/marcinludwig">Marcin Ludwig</a>  for conducting a thorough code review of this application also thanks to  <a href="https://github.com/Innei">Innei</a>  for providing the configured initial version.

This project is a testament to modern web development practices, combining a variety of tools and technologies to deliver a comprehensive, user-friendly, and efficient application.
